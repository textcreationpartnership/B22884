            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving receiv'd the sorrowful Intelligence of your Lordships late mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, in being Taken into Custody, I can forbear no longer to Condole the unhappy Circumstances, I am inform'd you lye now under; But being willing to afford your Lordship what Consolation, the promise of a Holy Fathers care over your troubled Soul, can give you, I here assure you, I have made Intercession to his Holiness, and with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty have procur'd you a general pardon, Sign'd with his own hand, for all those Manifold black Sins and Enormities you have been Guilty of, through the illegal Execution of that Honourable Authority, His Majesty was pleas'd (for your great service to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church) to confer upon you.</p>
            <p>And knowing 'twas the custom of your Lordship to set a-part New-Years Day for the Reception of those obscure presents, which oftentimes altered the property of a case, and made a bad cause a good one, by placing Justice on the wrong side the hedge; I have therefore thought it convenient to inclose the Pardon in this Epistle, and entreat your Lordship to accept it, as a New-Years-Gift, Sincerely intended as a Benefit to your great Soul; and to discharge you of the weight of those premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Crimes, which we fear double the oppression of your Lordships present calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; I must confess there is abundance to be said in Vindication of what the World Taxes, as a great fault upon you, for who would covet to be advanc'd to Honourable offices of State, without a private end of making an advantage equal to its Grandure, to buoy up the desire of being still Greater, and Ambition incident to most Great Men, who have rais'd their Fortune like your Lordship.</p>
            <p>I am very much dissatisfied, to think your Lordship (being a Man accounted of so great Pollicy, and Judgment) should not take a more timely Care to secure your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at this Juncture, than I perceive you did. And when you had made so great a step to your preservation, as to Cast Anchor privately in Rope Ally, you must be so indescreet upon a small Bussle in the place, to be peeping, by which I understand you were discovered; and now according to the Old English Proverb, I fear They will make <hi>You pay for your peeping:</hi> But pray, if the Laws should deal so severely by you, as to force you to dye a Martyr, and disunite a wise Noddle, from those shoulders, which have bore so many Poor Mens Curses, and Rich Mens Slanders: let me entreat you to dye with a Good Courage, for you shall only call at <hi>Purgatory</hi> for fashions sake, and continue short time e're our Prayers shall convey you to a place (if the Curses of the people of <hi>England</hi> prevent not) where you shall enjoy the full of those blessings lay'd up by the Church, for such Worthy Agents as your Lordship: Being the Care of him, who remains till Death. (which I fear will meet you in a short time)</p>
